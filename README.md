A PCB to interface an MSGEQ7 seven channel graphic equalizer IC to my smart sensor platform [link](https://github.com/2468shrm/M4_CAN_Feather_Carrier_v6). The board has a microphone input jack, the MSGEQ7 IC, and three 3-position square pin headers. One header for RESET, one for STROBE, and one for the analog OUTPUT.  These are connected to two DIOs and an AIN, respectively.
